This preview shows 3 approaches:

1. APPROACH 1: Specialized models with full dialogue
   - No prompting capability
   - Returns blended score for both speakers

2. APPROACH 2: Qwen with explicit prompts
   - Full conversation + prompt to focus on specific speaker
   - Tests if prompting can isolate speaker traits
   - Runs twice: once for "You", once for "Them"

3. APPROACH 3: Physical speaker separation
   - Separate text by speaker before sending
   - Current implementation in llm_analyzer.py

Review the prompts above. If they look good, run:
  python test_speaker_separation.py

If you want to edit the prompts, modify the test_speaker_separation.py file.
